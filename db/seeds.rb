# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# require 'faker'
# #
# #
# # Student.destroy_all
# students = 20.times do
#   first_name = Faker::Name.first_name
#   last_name = Faker::Name.last_name
#   Student.create({:first_name => "#{first_name}", :last_name => "#{last_name}"}) end

# require 'faker'
#
#
#
# school_classes = 20.times do
#   title = Faker::ProgrammingLanguage.name
#   room_number = Faker::Number.number(3)
#   SchoolClass.create({:title => "#{title}", :room_number => "#{room_number}"}) end
